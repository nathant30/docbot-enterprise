## 🤖 Agent System Architecture

**12 Specialized AI Agents Ready:**

1. **ORCHESTRATOR-PRIME** - Project coordination and task management
2. **ALICE-BACKEND** - FastAPI + PostgreSQL backend development
3. **BOB-OCR-AI** - Multi-OCR processing and AI data extraction
4. **CHARLIE-FRONTEND** - React + TypeScript dashboard
5. **DIANA-INTEGRATION** - ERP system integrations
6. **EVE-INFRASTRUCTURE** - Docker + AWS deployment
7. **FELIX-QA-ENGINEER** - Testing and quality assurance
8. **HENRY-KNOWLEDGE** - Documentation and knowledge management
9. **GRACE-SECURITY** - Security and compliance monitoring
10. **IVY-PERFORMANCE** - Performance optimization
11. **JACK-RESOURCES** - Resource and infrastructure management
12. **KATE-CLIENT** - Client communication and project management

## 🎯 Quick Start Instructions

### 1. Set Your API Key
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### 2. Install Dependencies (Optional)
```bash
pip install -r orchestrator/requirements.txt
```

### 3. Launch the Multi-Agent System
```bash
cd docbot-enterprise
python3 orchestrator/run_development.py
```

### 4. Monitor Progress
The system will show real-time agent activity:
```
[10:15:30] ORCHESTRATOR-PRIME: 🚀 Starting development cycle...
[10:15:31] ALICE-BACKEND: 📝 Starting task: Create FastAPI Foundation
[10:18:45] FELIX-QA-ENGINEER: ✅ Backend foundation passes quality gates
```

## 📋 What's Included

### ✅ Complete PRD Suite
- **MASTER_PRD.md**: Comprehensive 29KB specification with all requirements
